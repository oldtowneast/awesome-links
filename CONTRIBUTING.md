# Contributing to Awesome Links 🌐

Hey there! I’m thrilled you’re interested in helping grow **Awesome Links**. This project is all about sharing cool corners of the web, and your ideas—whether it’s a link, a category, or a suggestion—are what keep it alive. Here’s how you can jump in, no matter your experience level.

## How to Contribute
There are two easy ways to add your voice: submitting an **issue** (like a suggestion box) or a **pull request** (a way to directly add or tweak stuff). Don’t worry if these sound unfamiliar—I’ll walk you through both!

### Option 1: Submit an Issue
An issue is perfect for suggesting a link, proposing a new category, or pointing out something to improve. It’s like dropping a note in the mailbox.

1. **Head to the Issues Tab**: On the [Awesome Links repo page](https://github.com/oldtowneast/awesome-links), click the “Issues” tab near the top.
2. **Click ‘New Issue’**: You’ll see a green button that says “New Issue”—give it a tap.
3. **Fill It Out**: Add a title (e.g., “Cool link: Markdown tool”) and a quick description. If it’s a link, include the URL and maybe why you think it fits. No pressure to be formal!
4. **Submit**: Hit “Submit new issue,” and you’re done! I’ll see it and we can chat about it there.

### Option 2: Submit a Pull Request
A pull request (PR) is for when you want to add or edit something directly—like updating the `awesome-links.md` file with a new link yourself. It’s a bit more hands-on but still straightforward.

1. **Fork the Repo**: On the [repo page](https://github.com/oldtowneast/awesome-links), click “Fork” (top right) to make your own copy.
2. **Edit Your Copy**: In your forked repo, find `awesome-links.md`, click the pencil icon to edit, and add your link or change. Keep the format simple: `- [Site Name](URL) - Short description.`
3. **Commit Your Changes**: Scroll down, add a quick note about what you changed (e.g., “Added a new CMS link”), and hit “Commit changes.”
4. **Create the Pull Request**: Back on your fork, click “Pull requests,” then “New pull request.” You’ll see your changes compared to mine—hit “Create pull request” and add a title/comment if you like.
5. **Submit**: Send it over! I’ll review it, and we’ll merge it in if it’s a fit.

If you’re new to this, GitHub has a [handy guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) with screenshots too. No rush—take your time!

## What I’m Looking For
- **Links**: Anything useful, quirky, or nostalgic—think tools, resources, or hidden web gems. Include a short description so we know what’s up.
- **Categories**: Ideas to group links if the list gets big.
- **Vibe**: Keep it in the spirit of old-school web directories—fun, functional, or fascinating.

## A Quick Note
This is a personal project I’m opening up to others, so I’ll check contributions to make sure they vibe with the collection. If something doesn’t fit, I’ll explain why—no hard feelings!

## Questions?
Stuck? Not sure where to start? Feel free to open an issue just to say hi or ask—I’m here to help. Let’s make **Awesome Links** even more awesome together!
